  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <h3>About Me!</h3>
  <p>I am a 27 year old Army veteran who is interested making a career change into front end development. I joined SavvyCoders with the intent of learning what I need to know to make this happen. Building a strong foundation, learning to think like a programmer, and developing a keen eye for writing clean code and following best practices are what intend to get out of this course. Outside of the course, I spend my days working as a security guard in downtown Nashville, spend time with my dog, or spend time with my roommates playing video games, or scootin' around Nashville. If there is anything else you'd like to know or discuss, you can contact via text or call at my number <a href="../index.html"> here</a></p>

  <h3>Also, here is a table of CSS stuff.</h3>
  <table style="width:25%">
      <tr>
        <th>Selector</th>
        <th>A thing</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Class selector</td>
        <td>. It's a period</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Id selector</td>
        <td># It's a hashtag</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Psudo Selector</td>
        <td>: It's a colon</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
