        <h3>Eric Loux, Renaissance Man</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Eric Loux, and I'm searching for the six-fingered man who killed my father. In the meantime, I'm spending my time working as a transportation manager, moving construction and mining equipment around the US and Canada. I enjoy playing classical guitar and have had orchestras perform my original compositions. Programming has always been a passion of mine, and I'm glad to be learning front-end development through Savvy Coders. In my free time, I like to try and mount people (as that's what you try to do in jiu jitsu... what were you thinking?).
